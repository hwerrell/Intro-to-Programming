Werrell_CYOA_while_loops.py follows the original format we learned. I included it to show my adherence to the initial coding structure taught in class.

The second file, Werrell_CYOA is a more polished version, including a UDF. I decided to omit the while loops and , as my code functions the same without them. I believe this approach is effective, but Iâ€™m open to discussing any potential misalignment with the project requirements in class.

Thanks,
